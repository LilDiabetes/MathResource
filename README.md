## Branch Structure

main branches: `deploy` | `develop` 

temporary branches: `front` | `back` [ from `develop` ]

- `deploy` - stable branch
- `develop` - working branch
- `front` - workspace for front-end division
- `back` - workspace for back-end division


### pull request
All the pull requests are sent to your `division` branch.  
When creating new branch, always use the structure of the branch anatomy.

branch anatomy: `division`/`type`/`title`

divisions: `front` | `back`

`division` branch is synced to the `development` branch once a week.
